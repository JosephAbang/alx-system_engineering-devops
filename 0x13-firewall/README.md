# Project: 0x13. Firewall

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing firewall rules to secure servers. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of firewalls and apply them to enhance server security.

## Background Context
Firewalls play a crucial role in protecting servers from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. They act as barriers between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.

## Resources
- [What is a firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))
- [Web stack debugging guide](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/33)

## Key Concepts
- Understanding firewall functionality and importance
- Configuring firewall rules to control network traffic
- Testing firewall configurations using telnet and other tools
- Avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring server accessibility

## Instructions
- Implement firewall rules to restrict or allow specific types of network traffic.
- Test firewall configurations using telnet or other tools to ensure proper functionality.
- Follow best practices to avoid locking yourself out of servers and maintain accessibility.

## Warning
- Exercise caution when configuring firewall rules, as improper settings can lead to unintended consequences, including loss of server access.
- Verify firewall configurations thoroughly before logging out of servers to prevent potential issues.

## Note
- This project does not utilize Docker containers due to limitations.
- It's recommended to test firewall configurations from outside the school network, such as from a web-02 server, to bypass network-based firewall restrictions.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, you'll gain valuable experience in configuring firewalls to enhance server security. Understanding firewall principles and best practices is essential for any DevOps or SysAdmin role, contributing to the overall reliability and integrity of IT infrastructure.
