# Web Infrastructure Design Project

This project involves designing various web infrastructure scenarios. It covers concepts related to DNS, monitoring, web servers, network basics, load balancers, and servers. The goal is to understand the components of web infrastructure, system redundancy, and various acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Concepts
- DNS
- Monitoring
- Web Server
- Network basics
- Load balancer
- Server

## Learning Objectives
- General web stack components
- System redundancy
- Key acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Task Details

### 0. Simple web stack

Design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com. Provide explanations for the key components and issues.

### 1. Distributed web infrastructure

Design a three server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. Describe the added components and differences between Active-Active and Active-Passive setups.

### 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

Design a three server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com with security and monitoring features. Explain the role of firewalls, HTTPS, and monitoring tools.
